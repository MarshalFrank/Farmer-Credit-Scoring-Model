# Farmer Credit Scoring Model

## Overview
This project develops a predictive model to assess loan repayment likelihood among smallholder farmers using financial and operational indicators.

## Objective
To classify farmers as:
- 1 = Paid (Loan Repaid)
- 0 = Unpaid (Loan Default)

## Key Features
- Age
- Education (years)
- Farming Experience (years)
- Distance to Loan Source (km)
- Loan-to-Asset Ratio
- Operating Expense-to-Income Ratio
- Farm Size (hectares)

## Methods Used
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Correlation Analysis
- Random Forest Classification
- Logistic Regression Benchmarking
- Feature Importance Analysis

## Results
- Random Forest Accuracy: 93%
- Strong predictive power from leverage and cost ratios
- Clear financial interpretability

## Business Insights
- High leverage significantly increases default risk
- High operating cost pressure reduces repayment capacity
- Model can support risk-based lending decisions
